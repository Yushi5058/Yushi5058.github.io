      <h1>Hey, my name is Elias,</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">I make websites alive.</p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about making <em>alive in the web</em>. I started my
        journey as <em>a developer</em> when I was a teenager. I was taking my shower and
        wondering how Internet became like how we see it nowadays. That
        curiosity has fed me years and years making my passion for <em>the Internet</em>
        grow day after day.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the years, I've cultivated my passion for <em>coding</em> by studying the IT
        field, but most of all, by challenging myself to <em>create new things</em>
        innovative and useful for humanity, or at least for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lately, I discovered my passion for <em>web development</em> and the beauty
        behind building amazing websites, and the most fascinating thing about
        is making them alive. My projects are all listed here and additional
        ones are on my <em>github account</em>, I hope they are as fascinating and
        beautiful in your point of view as mine.
